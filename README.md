libft
=====

My version of 42-libft a pure C-89 libc implementation. 
For pedagical purpose please do not copy without understant it.

This version purpose some easy to understand function of the libc,
without overly complicated defines.

But if you are a computer science student you may think before copying this
lib. Coding groove come with practice, copying is not coding.

So do not use this lib for homework your teacher will be very angry if he
learn it.
